## Part 6: Interface-Driven Persistence with Storage
- Defined a `Storable` interface with a `toDataString()` method.
- Modified `Student`, `Course`, and `AttendanceRecord` classes to implement the `Storable` interface and provide their specific `toDataString()` implementations (CSV format).
- Created a `FileStorageService` class with a `saveData(List<? extends Storable> items, String filename)` method to write `Storable` objects to a text file.
- Utilized `try-with-resources` for safe file handling (`PrintWriter`, `FileWriter`).
- Demonstrated in `Main.java` how to save lists of students, courses, and attendance records to separate files (`students.txt`, `courses.txt`, `attendance_log.txt`).
- Discussed the flexibility provided by interfaces for handling different types of storable objects uniformly.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/*.java`
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`
4. Check the generated files: `students.txt`, `courses.txt`, `attendance_log.txt`.
